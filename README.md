# kata

> Kata (åž‹), meaning "form," "model," or "pattern." This aligns with the structured approach of systemd unit files, Dockerfiles/Quadlets for Podman, and Caddyfiles, representing the defined "forms" for deploying and managing applications

# Requirements

`kata` requires a system with `systemd`, `podman`, and `caddy` installed. It is designed to work with the following versions:

- `systemd`: 239 or later
- `podman`: 4.0 or later
- `caddy`: 2.4 or later
- `podman-compose`: 1.0 or later

This means that Debian 13 (Trixie) or later is a requirement.
